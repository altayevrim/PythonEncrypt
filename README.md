# PythonEncrypt
A small script that helps encrypt your files with ease!

## Usage
Just copy the encrypt.py and decrypt.py files to the folder that you want to use the script.
This script will encrypt/decrypt all available files automatically.

## Key Files
The system will create a new key file automatically if there isn't. The default name of the Key File is **rimtay.key**. You can change it with **KEYFILE** variable.

## Accepted Files
To prevent encrypt all files in the current folder, the system has a built in feature that chooses only the necessary files. You can edit the Allowed Files with the **ALLOWED_FILES** variable. 
**IMPORTANT! DO NOT ADD *.key* and *.py* FILES! OTHERWISE SYSTEM WILL ENCRYPT YOUR KEY FILE TOO!**
*Default Allowed_Files Variable*
ALLOWED_FILES = [".txt",".png",".jpg",".jpeg",".gif",".doc","docx",".mp4",".mp3",".pdf",".odt",".xls",".xlsx",".json",".php",".exe",".sql",".csv",".xml"]

## No Warranty
System is created only for test purposes and there is no warranty, not at all! **Use it at your own risk!**
